# Unreleased

What's new

- New: You can now stick the edit box to the top of the chat window! Very useful if you like chat flush to a bottom corner.
- New: You no longer need a 16,000 DPI gaming mouse to move Glass to the perfect spot. Now you can use sliders for window positioning.
- New: More control over the font, including leading, line padding, and outline.
- New: New options for controlling animations. Now you can adjust how fast messages fade in, fade out, and slide in. You can even set these to zero to disable animations completely if that's not your cup of tea.
- New: This thing! Glass is getting constant updates with new features and fixes added almost weekly. We thought it would be a good idea to write up changes and new stuff between each release. Watch this space!

Bug fixes

- Fixed: Sometimes messages do not appear. This now happens... even less often!
