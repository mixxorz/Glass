**Does the Glass work if you disable all other addons?**
If yes, that means Glass is conflicting with another addon. Try enabling all your addons one at a time to see which addon causes Glass to error out, then report back!

If Glass is still misbehaving after disabling all other addons, then it might be an issue with Glass itself.
