## Why?

I wanted to have a chat UI that didn't look like it was designed in 2004.

I tried several addons that customize the chat interface but was left
unsatisfied. So I decided to make one myself.

The goal of Glass is to be unobtrusive. Messages only appear when they come in
and fades out after a few seconds. Chat tabs are hidden until the player hovers
over the chat UI. There is no always-visible background. Glass is invisible
until the player needs it.

## Install

Glass is available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/glass)

You may also download the latest release on [GitHub](https://github.com/mixxorz/Glass/releases)

## Commands

* `/glass` - open the settings window
* `/glass lock` - unlock the chat frame

## Customization

Not everyone likes the same look. Glass tries to accommodate your own
preferences by giving you options to change the:

* Chat frame width, height, and location
* Font and font size
* Message fade out delay
* Background opacity

Moreover, unlike the default chat UI, these settings may be shared between
characters.

## Addon compatibility

### ElvUI

Glass works with ElvUI, but make sure to disable the Chat module.

### Prat 3.0

Glass works with Prat, but make sure to disable the EditBox module.

Prat Timestamps work with Glass but with a caveat. Prat allows you to select
which tabs to enable timestamps on. This is currently not supported and
Timestamps will be enabled on all tabs if the Prat Timestamps module is loaded.
If you want to disable Prat Timestamps, you'll need to set the module to "Don't
load" (just "Disabled" won't work).

Note: WoW's built-in timestamps work with Glass. (Interface -> Social ->
Timestamps)

### Leatrix Plus

Glass works with Leatrix Plus. You might encounter issues when enabling features
that modify chat behaviour such as "Recent chat window" or "Use easy resizing".
Switching these features off will resolve issues with Glass.
